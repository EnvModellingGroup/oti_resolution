Videos and animation for Hill et al.
=====================================

neap_comparison_1076400.mp4 - comparison of low, medium and high resolution neap tidal release at 1076400 second from start of simulations

spring_comparison_314880.mp4 - as above, but for the spring tide starting at 314880 seconds

There are then three directories; one per resolution. In each directory there are:
 - 16 videos corresponding to each release point for the spring tide cycle
 - 16 videos corresponding to each release in the neap tide cycle
 - a comparison of of the neap tides (low_neap.mp4, med_neap.mp4 or high_neap.mp4)
 - as above, but for the spring tides

high_flow.avi - animation of the flow from the high resolution simulation
